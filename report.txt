Introduction - a description of the lab in your own words
    The goal of this lab was to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS
    by creating a web page of my schedule for the second term of this school year.

    Key elements in this lab include the use of:
        - different CSS files for both viewing and printing the website.
        - pseudo-classes in table data elements.
        - classes to specify how elements rendered.
        - ids to target specific elements.

Summary - a reflection of what you learned in this lab
    The most significant thing I learned in this lab was the ability to have your website
    render differently depending on the viewing media. I have had experience with HTML and CSS
    but have never come across this capability.

    Another thing I did not have a lot of experience with is formatting tables. When rowspan is
    set to a value greater than one, it counts that table data as present in all the rows it occupies.
    This shifted some of the data that was already present to different columns. This was something I
    had to overcome.

Suggestions - a list of suggestions for improvement and/or what you enjoyed about this lab
    Table cells should be hyperlinked to other html pages that provide course descriptions.
